    <h1> The 10 most famous lakes in the world </h1>
    <p> Lakes are freshwater bodies that are enclosed by land on all sides.
       The primary difference between a lake and a river is that rivers are
        connected to another body of water- whether it be an ocean, a sea,
         a lake, or another river. Lakes, however, have no place to go.
    <br>Read on to discover 10 of the world's most famous lakes.
